                       <p>Over the last 10 years, Andrew Thiele has become known<br>
                        as the founder of Artek, a thriving creative agency based in midtown
                        Manhattan. More recently, Thiele is  recognized for his large-scale paintings
                        that redefine culture and cross  socio-economic borders from 5th
                        avenue advertising to lost signage in the Bronx. The prolific outsider artist
                        leads his audience through intimate views of urbanization and pop culture.</p>
