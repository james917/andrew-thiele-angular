                    <h2>ABOUT</h2>  
                    Over the last 10 years, Andrew Thiele has become known
                    as the founder of Artek, a thriving creative agency based in midtown
                    Manhattan. More recently, Thiele is recognized for his large-scale paintings
                    that redefine culture and cross socio-economic borders from 5th 
                    avenue-advertising to lost signage in the Bronx. The prolific artist
                    leads his audience through intimate views of urbanization and pop culture.
