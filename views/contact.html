                       <p>Someone once asked me “why” Why do I make art....<br>  
                        Whether it be artwork to represent their brand with my agency<br>
                        or artwork I make for myself from my soul. I am constantly creating.
                         Its who I am, and why I am here. Art is part of my existence..</p>
